In a land far away with ghosts and demons, lived an elf. A shy small elf, named Chad, who was sad all the time, he felt like he did not belong in this scary land. All he wanted to do was make toys and eat candy, but he had to spend all his time hiding from the ghosts and demons. He dreamed of snow and meeting his elf parents and feeling like he belonged, instead of feeling scared and alone all the time. One day, Chad ran straight up to a demon and he was scared the demon would kill him, but the demon looked at Chad and asked him what was wrong. After a little while of talking to the demon, Chad felt like he was making a friend, his first friend in the land. His new friends name was Kyle.
Kyle wasn't like the other demons. He liked chad, candy and toys. But kyle hated his demon body. For as long as kyle has existed, he has surpressed his demonic impulses, locking them away in the depths of his mind. Chad knew nothing of kyles demonic nature, he felt safe around kyle, but he had yet to meet any other demons. Chad only met with kyle during the day, and kyle never brought chad to his lair, knowing full well that the other demons would consume chad if given the chance. One day kyle woke up to a knocking, he got up and looked out the window. It was chad.
