In a land far away with ghosts and demons, lived an elf. A shy small elf, named Chad, who was sad all the time, he felt like he did not belong in this scary land. All he wanted to do was make toys and eat candy, but he had to spend all his time hiding from the ghosts and demons. He dreamed of snow and meeting his elf parents and feeling like he belonged, instead of feeling scared and alone all the time. One day, Chad ran straight up to a demon and he was scared the demon would kill him, but the demon looked at Chad and asked him what was wrong. After a little while of talking to the demon, Chad felt like he was making a friend, his first friend in the land. His new friends name was Kyle.
